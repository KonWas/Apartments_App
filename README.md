App concerning price prediction of an apartment

Included:
1. Graphs for analysis of the market
2. Prediction window, where you input data about an apartment (including choosing location from an interactive map) and as a result get predicted price
3. Investment window - simple ROI calculator on selected apartment, which you chose from a list (you can see the details of this apartment and you can use filters on the list)

Models used for predictions (really basic ML):
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- SVR
- Simple NN
  
To run program, first I recommend training the models:
prediction_models.py change train = True in the main func
